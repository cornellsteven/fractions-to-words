h3. What is it?

A php class to convert fractions to English words. (IE, "1/2" = "one half", "3/16" = "three sixteenths")

h3. How do I use it?

Just require the "FractionsToWords.php" class and use the convert() function.

	Example:
	require 'FractionsToWords.php';
	$FractionsToWords = new FractionsToWords();
	echo $FractionsToWords->convert('1/2');

h3. I love it but would you add/fix 'that'?

Just open an issue on Github and I will fix/add it if it makes sense.
